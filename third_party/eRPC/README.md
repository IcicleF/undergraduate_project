# eRPC

eRPC is a fast and general-purpose RPC library for datacenter networks.
The NSDI 2019 [paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/doc/nsdi19/erpc_nsdi19.pdf)
describes the system in detail.
[Documentation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/erpc_doc) is available online.

## Compilation

Do not run CMake in this directory, because the CMakeLists.txt has been severely
modified. Goto the root directory of Galois and run `cmake` there.
